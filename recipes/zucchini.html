    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>During the summer, our gardens are filled with more zucchini than we know what to do with, and I hunt down all my zucchini recipes. Here is one quick and easy way of preparing zucchini. <br>

        I had a variation of this baked zucchini the other night at a friend's house and was amazed to hear her children exclaim, "Please give me some zucchini. I love zucchini!" Hello? When was the last time you heard that?</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound zucchini, each cut in half across the middle, then each half quartered lengthwise</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon fresh minced garlic cloves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon Herbes de Provence or dried thyme, or 1 teaspoon of fresh chopped thyme</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450°F. Make sure there is a rack in the top third of the oven.</li>
                <li>Place the zucchini and garlic in a bowl and toss with olive oil. <br>
                    Spread the zucchini out onto a foil or silicone-lined sheet pan, skin side down. Sprinkle with salt (1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon).</li>
                <li>Roast the zucchini at 450°F for 8 to 15 minutes, or until it begins to brown. (Start checking at about 7 minutes and keep checking every few minutes.)</li>
                <li>Once the zucchini has started to brown at the edges, remove it from the oven and place the zucchini in a bowl. Gently mix in the herbs and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ol>
